width of 3-segment display is wrong, will need to bend all leads to fit
IS 22.86 mm (0.9")
***SHOULD BE just under 1.00" 

require stand-alone programming pins

***SHOULD BE ICE header
- pull-up on SWCLK pin 1k (10k?) [has internal pull-up at start-up per page 88 of SAML21 foc, 15.6.2]

***consider through-hole 10k thermistor
***add /MR reset to allow toggle of 18.8V rail

1/12/19 lots of issues determining how to program SAML21 vs the ATTINY85 in the last project
need special debugger, beware educaton license limitations.  Was assuming everything could be done over USB - but only true after first flash

***add compressed air and flux to parts list

***typo on "electronic" missing 'c'

need BOM print out for CCA fab, part placement
0402 heats up quickly during rework (bkth ends of part)
desire refactot with 0805 since 0402 are challenging to work with
not all parts (0805) lie perfectly flat
issue with gettting solder out of voltera for larger pcb pads (hot/dry solder?)
observe short (?) under usb header
PMIC has no bond (solder reflow point is higher than default Votera temperature)
reworked other issues by hand (incomplete passive bonding, SAML lead bridging)

- 1/17/20
***1.8V and 3.3V are shorted
***add test point for every voltage, i2c

***add place for debug led (no-pop in final model?)
