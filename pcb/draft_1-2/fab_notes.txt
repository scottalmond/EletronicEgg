as-delivered
width of 3-segment display is wrong, will need to bend all leads to fit
IS 22.86 mm (0.9")
x ***SHOULD BE just under 1.00" 

require stand-alone programming pins

***SHOULD BE ICE header
- pull-up on SWCLK pin 1k (10k?) [has internal pull-up at start-up per page 88 of SAML21 foc, 15.6.2]
https://learn.adafruit.com/programming-an-m0-using-an-arduino
- 100k on SWDIO https://www.microchip.com/webdoc/GUID-B2CE0E6C-70BF-42CF-B0CF-6705800FC877/index.html?GUID-18A97AEC-DA07-42C5-A2DA-478F7092C442

x ***consider through-hole 10k thermistor
x ***add /MR reset to allow toggle of 1.8V rail

x ***add compressed air and flux to parts list [why air...?]

x ***typo on "electronic" missing 'c'

x ***1.8V and 3.3V are shorted
x ***add test point for every voltage, i2c.  5V, 3V3, 1V8, GND, SDA, SCL

x ***add place for debug led (no-pop in final model?)

x *** review power connections to saml21 vs checklist

x *** review v1.1 mock-up functionality

x *** 2.2 --> 10uF?

option to glue pcbs together for badge
 cyanoacrylate glue

x *** will 100 mil header fit adjacent to 3 segment screen?
x *** verify each silkscreen identified is exactly next to associated pad, not one over

get wire cutters that sever really close to onee edge for flat finish

x *** straighten test points

buy extra batty bq25155 ICs

x *** review bq25155, determine what caps are used on dev board

x *** avoid vias under silkscren as it makes text hard to read

***buy flux in next order

*** buy digikey parts including through-hole thermistor
*** and close wire cutters
1.3" lead length-ish

is useful to put test point pads directly opposite foot prints used by ICs (no overlap of vias/traces)

*** buy clip leads for bq25155 breadboarding
