eletronic egg

features:
display the max acceleration to the user
  allow moderator to reset data collection between users
solution to fit within standard size chicken egg
  use a single AAA battery as cheap, compact, and readily-available power source
designed to last multiple years
  enter a low-power mode after X hours of inactivity from user

familiar with AtTiny85, so use that
familiar with Digikey, so use them
egg dims: 60 mm x 45 mm --> 2.35" x 1.77"
for aceleration tolerance, plan to fill in with epoxy
  choose clear epoxy so screen can by fully submerged (less concern about mating surface)
egg is about 25 oz
  look for 
consider metal ring around middle: rotate to proper position to remove battery --> ring would obscure the screen
consider using no mechanical user input, that way whole device acn be simply dropped into a tank of epoxy (no keep out zones)
  "<tap x, y, z> to turn ON/RESET" rSt where t=8-7, or spin egg (excess g's for sustained period)
  "Turns OFF after 4 hours of no inversion"
consider pinhole for battery outgassing
can canabalize some of the 7-segment pins on teh most significant digiet on the display for extra I/O
need some kind of mark to indicate which way to read the screen (top/bottom)
hmm, almost not worth implementing a low power mode, 24mA for the screen and <1mA for the accel, and [0.2-4.5 mA at 1-8 Mhz] for uP <68mA for 5 yr life
worried about g-loads depressing spring in battery clip (it they're removable)
  using individual contact clips instead, leave gap in middle of board to have programming header accessible (when batteries are out)
  PB2-4 and PC6 to programmer https://www.tindie.com/products/drazzy/attiny88-or-828-breakout-board-assembled/
consider lipo charger and 3.3V regulator
  allows batteries to be replaced (charged through usb port)
  future-proof with usb-c header for charging
  if going to have a usb header anyway, consider samd21 for readme over usb, and practice samd21 designs

    38-pin I/O
  OR consider dime cell lipo: undervoltage lock-out: only has ON mode for ~1 week?
issue with finding a proper UVLO circuit

consider turning VDDIO ON/OFF at 3.3V for all periphreals to save power
but how to input an interrupt to awaken the system if I/O is OFF.....

plan to recharge once a year

battery, uP, accel, screen, current limit resistors --> ~$25 part cost
  could save ~4 bucks by getting H3LIS100DL accel instead with range limited to 100g's

add LED for status
